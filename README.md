### SEEK Ghost Detector MakeCode Library

This library is part of [The Digital Ghost Hunt](digitalghosthunt.com) an AHRC-funded project in coding education and Immersive theatre.  If you have no idea what that is, visit our website first.  The rest will make more sense.

This repository contains the custom SEEK MakeCode library students will use to program the Micro:Bit part of the detector.

It needs work.
